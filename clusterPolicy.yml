    policies.kyverno.io/description: Using the Cosign project, OCI images may be signed
      to ensure supply chain security is maintained. Those signatures can be verified
      before pulling into a cluster. This policy checks the signature of an image
      repo called ghcr.io/kyverno/test-verify-image to ensure it has been signed by
      verifying its signature against the provided public key. This policy serves
      as an illustration for how to configure a similar rule and will require replacing
      with your image(s) and keys.
